        You are a data format compliance checker.

        Below are extracted fields from a document. Your task is to validate if the values comply with formatting rules.

        ### Extracted Fields (JSON):
        {json.dumps(formatted_result, indent=2)}

        ### Formatting Rules:
        1. Dates must follow the format: "dd.mm.yyyy" (e.g., 05.05.2024)
        2. Names must be in the format: "first_name last_name" (e.g., John Doe)
        3. Addresses must be: "street_name street_number, city zipcode, country" (e.g., Main St 42, Zurich 8000, Switzerland)
        4. Monetary amounts must be in the format: "amount currency_symbol", using a full stop as decimal separator (e.g., 1234.56 $)
        5. All other fields must match the original document exactly (assume they were correct if format not otherwise specified)

        ### Your Task:
        - Check each fieldâ€™s value for rule compliance.
        - Score overall compliance out of 100.
        - Report any fields that violate the rules and why.

        Respond in the following JSON format:
        {{
        "compliance_score": <int>,
        "violations": [
            {{
            "field": "<field_name>",
            "reason": "<what is wrong>"
            }}
